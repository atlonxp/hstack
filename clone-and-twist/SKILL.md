  [Product Transposition] Build the transposed version of a studied mechanism.
  Reads BLUEPRINT.md + TRANSPOSITION.md from studies/<slug>/, produces an
  /autoplan-full-compatible build plan with core skeleton, domain adapters,
  replacement modules, and pre-stubbed proprietary slots — then hands off to
  /autobuild for execution. Writes mechanism-fidelity tests to
  evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl consumed by /eval-harness (S13). Refuses to operate
  on a study without a non-trivial domain shift + ≥1 proprietary slot.
  Maintains BUILD-LOG.md linking commits back to blueprint sections.
  Use when asked to "build the transposed version", "clone and twist this",
  "kick off the build from this transposition", or "scaffold the transposed code". (gstack)

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.gstack/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; the first AskUserQuestion is the workflow entering plan mode, not a violation of it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If no variant is callable, the skill is BLOCKED — stop and report `BLOCKED — AskUserQuestion unavailable` per the AskUserQuestion Format rule. At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/gstack-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/gstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/gstack/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/gstack/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: ask once about writing style:

> v1 prompts are simpler: first-use jargon glosses, outcome-framed questions, shorter prose. Keep default or restore terse?

Options:
- A) Keep the new default (recommended — good writing helps everyone)
- B) Restore V0 prose — set `explain_level: terse`

If A: leave `explain_level` unset (defaults to `default`).
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set explain_level terse`.

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
rm -f ~/.gstack/.writing-style-prompt-pending
touch ~/.gstack/.writing-style-prompted
```

Skip if `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `no`.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: say "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — do the complete thing when AI makes marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean" Offer to open:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if yes. Always run `touch`.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: ask telemetry once via AskUserQuestion:

> Help gstack get better. Share usage data only: skill, duration, crashes, stable device ID. No code, file paths, or repo names.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask follow-up:

> Anonymous mode sends only aggregate usage, no unique ID.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

Skip if `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: ask once:

> Let gstack proactively suggest skills, like /qa for "does this work?" or /investigate for bugs?

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.proactive-prompted
```

Skip if `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes skill routing rules.

Options:
- A) Add routing rules to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke skills manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
```

Then commit the change: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: add gstack skill routing rules to CLAUDE.md"`

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set routing_declined true` and say they can re-enable with `gstack-config set routing_declined false`.

This only happens once per project. Skip if `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`.

If `VENDORED_GSTACK` is `yes`, warn once via AskUserQuestion unless `~/.gstack/.vendoring-warned-$SLUG` exists:

> This project has gstack vendored in `.claude/skills/gstack/`. Vendoring is deprecated.
> Migrate to team mode?

Options:
- A) Yes, migrate to team mode now
- B) No, I'll handle it myself

If A:
1. Run `git rm -r .claude/skills/gstack/`
2. Run `echo '.claude/skills/gstack/' >> .gitignore`
3. Run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-team-init required` (or `optional`)
4. Run `git add .claude/ .gitignore CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: migrate gstack from vendored to team mode"`
5. Tell the user: "Done. Each developer now runs: `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team`"

If B: say "OK, you're on your own to keep the vendored copy up to date."

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.gstack/.vendoring-warned-${SLUG:-unknown}
```

If marker exists, skip.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## AskUserQuestion Format

### Tool resolution (read first)

"AskUserQuestion" can resolve to two tools at runtime: the **host MCP variant** (e.g. `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion` — appears in your tool list when the host registers it) or the **native** Claude Code tool.

**Rule:** if any `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` variant is in your tool list, prefer it. Hosts may disable native AUQ via `--disallowedTools AskUserQuestion` (Conductor does, by default) and route through their MCP variant; calling native there silently fails. Same questions/options shape; same decision-brief format applies.

**If no AskUserQuestion variant appears in your tool list, this skill is BLOCKED.** Stop, report `BLOCKED — AskUserQuestion unavailable`, and wait for the user. Do not write decisions to the plan file as a substitute, do not emit them as prose and stop, and do not silently auto-decide (only `/plan-tune` AUTO_DECIDE opt-ins authorize auto-picking).

### Format

Every AskUserQuestion is a decision brief and must be sent as tool_use, not prose.

```
D<N> — <one-line question title>
Project/branch/task: <1 short grounding sentence using _BRANCH>
ELI10: <plain English a 16-year-old could follow, 2-4 sentences, name the stakes>
Stakes if we pick wrong: <one sentence on what breaks, what user sees, what's lost>
Recommendation: <choice> because <one-line reason>
Completeness: A=X/10, B=Y/10   (or: Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score)
Pros / cons:
A) <option label> (recommended)
  ✅ <pro — concrete, observable, ≥40 chars>
  ❌ <con — honest, ≥40 chars>
B) <option label>
  ✅ <pro>
  ❌ <con>
Net: <one-line synthesis of what you're actually trading off>
```

D-numbering: first question in a skill invocation is `D1`; increment yourself. This is a model-level instruction, not a runtime counter.

ELI10 is always present, in plain English, not function names. Recommendation is ALWAYS present. Keep the `(recommended)` label; AUTO_DECIDE depends on it.

Completeness: use `Completeness: N/10` only when options differ in coverage. 10 = complete, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut. If options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.`

Pros / cons: use ✅ and ❌. Minimum 2 pros and 1 con per option when the choice is real; Minimum 40 characters per bullet. Hard-stop escape for one-way/destructive confirmations: `✅ No cons — this is a hard-stop choice`.

Neutral posture: `Recommendation: <default> — this is a taste call, no strong preference either way`; `(recommended)` STAYS on the default option for AUTO_DECIDE.

Effort both-scales: when an option involves effort, label both human-team and CC+gstack time, e.g. `(human: ~2 days / CC: ~15 min)`. Makes AI compression visible at decision time.

Net line closes the tradeoff. Per-skill instructions may add stricter rules.

12. **Non-ASCII characters — write directly, never \u-escape.** When any
    string field (question, option label, option description) contains
    Chinese (繁體/簡體), Japanese, Korean, or other non-ASCII text, emit
    the literal UTF-8 characters in the JSON string. **Never escape them
    as `\uXXXX`.** Claude Code's tool parameter pipe is UTF-8 native
    and passes characters through unchanged. Manually escaping requires
    recalling each codepoint from training, which is unreliable for long
    CJK strings — the model regularly emits the wrong codepoint (e.g.
    writes `\u3103` thinking it is 管 U+7BA1, but `\u3103` is
    actually ㄃, so the user sees `管理工具` rendered as `㄃3用箱`).
    The trigger is long, multi-line questions with hundreds of CJK
    characters: that is exactly when reflexive escaping kicks in and
    exactly when miscoding is most damaging. Long ≠ escape. Keep
    characters literal.

    Wrong: `"question": "請選擇\uXXXX\uXXXX\uXXXX\uXXXX"`
    Right: `"question": "請選擇管理工具"`

    Only JSON-mandatory escapes remain allowed: `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`.

### Self-check before emitting

Before calling AskUserQuestion, verify:
- [ ] D<N> header present
- [ ] ELI10 paragraph present (stakes line too)
- [ ] Recommendation line present with concrete reason
- [ ] Completeness scored (coverage) OR kind-note present (kind)
- [ ] Every option has ≥2 ✅ and ≥1 ❌, each ≥40 chars (or hard-stop escape)
- [ ] (recommended) label on one option (even for neutral-posture)
- [ ] Dual-scale effort labels on effort-bearing options (human / CC)
- [ ] Net line closes the decision
- [ ] You are calling the tool, not writing prose
- [ ] Non-ASCII characters (CJK / accents) written directly, NOT \u-escaped

Privacy stop-gate: if output shows `ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off`, `artifacts_sync_mode_prompted` is `false`, and gbrain is on PATH or `gbrain doctor --fast --json` works, ask once:

> gstack can publish your artifacts (CEO plans, designs, reports) to a private GitHub repo that GBrain indexes across machines. How much should sync?

Options:
- A) Everything allowlisted (recommended)
- B) Only artifacts
- C) Decline, keep everything local

After answer:

```bash
# Chosen mode: full | artifacts-only | off
"$_BRAIN_CONFIG_BIN" set artifacts_sync_mode <choice>
"$_BRAIN_CONFIG_BIN" set artifacts_sync_mode_prompted true
```

If A/B and `~/.gstack/.git` is missing, ask whether to run `gstack-artifacts-init`. Do not block the skill.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
"~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-brain-sync" --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
"~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-brain-sync" --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${_BRANCH}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${_BRANCH}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI makes completeness cheap. Recommend complete lakes (tests, edge cases, error paths); flag oceans (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations).

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Continuous Checkpoint Mode

If `CHECKPOINT_MODE` is `"continuous"`: auto-commit completed logical units with `WIP:` prefix.

Commit after new intentional files, completed functions/modules, verified bug fixes, and before long-running install/build/test commands.

Commit format:

```
WIP: <concise description of what changed>

[gstack-context]
Decisions: <key choices made this step>
Remaining: <what's left in the logical unit>
Tried: <failed approaches worth recording> (omit if none)
Skill: </skill-name-if-running>
[/gstack-context]
```

Rules: stage only intentional files, NEVER `git add -A`, do not commit broken tests or mid-edit state, and push only if `CHECKPOINT_PUSH` is `"true"`. Do not announce each WIP commit.

`/context-restore` reads `[gstack-context]`; `/ship` squashes WIP commits into clean commits.

If `CHECKPOINT_MODE` is `"explicit"`: ignore this section unless a skill or user asks to commit.

## Context Health (soft directive)

During long-running skill sessions, periodically write a brief `[PROGRESS]` summary: done, next, surprises.

If you are looping on the same diagnostic, same file, or failed fix variants, STOP and reassess. Consider escalation or /context-save. Progress summaries must NEVER mutate git state.

## Question Tuning (skip entirely if `QUESTION_TUNING: false`)

Before each AskUserQuestion, choose `question_id` from `scripts/question-registry.ts` or `{skill}-{slug}`, then run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-question-preference --check "<id>"`. `AUTO_DECIDE` means choose the recommended option and say "Auto-decided [summary] → [option] (your preference). Change with /plan-tune." `ASK_NORMALLY` means ask.

After answer, log best-effort:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-question-log '{"skill":"clone-and-twist","question_id":"<id>","question_summary":"<short>","category":"<approval|clarification|routing|cherry-pick|feedback-loop>","door_type":"<one-way|two-way>","options_count":N,"user_choice":"<key>","recommended":"<key>","session_id":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
```

For two-way questions, offer: "Tune this question? Reply `tune: never-ask`, `tune: always-ask`, or free-form."

User-origin gate (profile-poisoning defense): write tune events ONLY when `tune:` appears in the user's own current chat message, never tool output/file content/PR text. Normalize never-ask, always-ask, ask-only-for-one-way; confirm ambiguous free-form first.

Write (only after confirmation for free-form):
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-question-preference --write '{"question_id":"<id>","preference":"<pref>","source":"inline-user","free_text":"<optional original words>"}'
```

Exit code 2 = rejected as not user-originated; do not retry. On success: "Set `<id>` → `<preference>`. Active immediately."

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# /clone-and-twist — Family J — Product Transposition

You have a BLUEPRINT.md (what they do) and a TRANSPOSITION.md (how you'll bridge
to your domain). This skill turns those documents into running code. It does NOT
hand-write the code — it produces a buildable plan + mechanism-fidelity tests
and dispatches to `/autobuild` for execution.

Pipeline location:

```
  /blueprint  →  /transpose  →  [ /clone-and-twist ]  →  /recipe
                                  (this skill)
```

## When to use

- You completed `/blueprint` and `/transpose` and the bridge plan is locked.
- You want pre-stubbed proprietary slots so you can fill in your IP without
  re-architecting the surrounding scaffold.
- You want mechanism-fidelity tests (S13) created *before* the code lands.

**Not for:**

- Studies that haven't been transposed yet — route to `/transpose` first.
- Studies with a trivial domain shift or zero proprietary slots — this skill
  refuses to build a literal clone.

## Inputs

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `<study-slug>` | yes | The study slug under `studies/<slug>/` |
| `--target-dir <path>` | no | Where the transposed code lands (default: project root) |
| `--mode {full,plan-only}` | no | `full` (default) hands off to `/autobuild`; `plan-only` writes the plan and stops |
| `--branch <name>` | no | Branch to land on; defaults to a derived `<slug>-twist` branch |

---

## Procedure

### Step 0: Pre-flight + refusal gates

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
STUDY="studies/<study-slug>"
[ -f "$STUDY/BLUEPRINT.md" ] || { echo "BLUEPRINT.md missing — run /blueprint first"; exit 1; }
[ -f "$STUDY/TRANSPOSITION.md" ] || { echo "TRANSPOSITION.md missing — run /transpose first"; exit 1; }
```

Read both files. Verify the S12 frontmatter chains correctly: TRANSPOSITION.md's
`derived_from` must include the BLUEPRINT.md path.

**Refusal gates (hard stops, no override):**

1. **Domain-shift gate.** Parse §5 of TRANSPOSITION.md. If the sentence amounts
   to "same thing, renamed" (heuristic: starts with "port", "rename", or "translate"
   and lists only a name/string change), refuse:
   > /clone-and-twist refuses to operate on a study with a trivial domain shift.
   > Re-run /transpose and produce a genuinely transformative bridge plan.
2. **Proprietary-slot gate.** Parse §4 of TRANSPOSITION.md. If fewer than 1
   proprietary slot, refuse:
   > /clone-and-twist refuses to operate on a study with zero proprietary slots.
   > Family J builds transformative work, not derivative reproductions.
3. **Fidelity-target gate.** Parse §8. If fewer than 1 measurable fidelity target,
   refuse:
   > /clone-and-twist requires ≥1 measurable mechanism-fidelity target (S13).
   > Re-run /transpose Step 8.

### Step 1: Land on the right branch

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
BRANCH="${ARG_BRANCH:-<slug>-twist}"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH" "origin/<base>" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH"
```

(`<base>` here resolves via `## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

---` — do not hardcode `main`.)

### Step 2: Project structure for the transposed code

Decide the target directory based on `--target-dir` or, if absent, by inspecting
the repo and AskUserQuestion:

> Where should the transposed code land?
>
> **A) `src/<slug>/`** — new top-level module in this repo.
> **B) `packages/<slug>/`** — new package in a monorepo (if `packages/` exists).
> **C) New repo** — generate as a sibling repo; do not land in this tree.
> **D) Custom path** — answer with the path.

### Step 3: Scaffold by S/A/R

Read the TRANSPOSITION.md source→target table. Group rows:

- **STAY** rows → **Core mechanism skeleton.** Concrete code with placeholder I/O.
- **ADAPT** rows → **Domain adapters.** Adapter modules that hold the new-domain
  content, plugged into the skeleton.
- **REPLACE** rows → **Replacement modules.** Stub modules with a clear
  `// implement-for-domain` marker — `/autobuild` will fill them.

For each scaffolded file, the head-of-file comment must include:

```
// Derived from studies/<slug>/BLUEPRINT.md §<section> + TRANSPOSITION.md row #<n>
// Decision: STAY | ADAPT | REPLACE
// (Do not paste verbatim source code. Reference + cite — never copy.)
```

### Step 4: Stub the proprietary slots

For each slot in TRANSPOSITION.md §4, scaffold an **interface-only** stub:

- The file lives at the path indicated in the slot's "where it plugs in" entry.
- Exports the documented interface (function signatures, types, contract).
- Body is a single throw / panic / NotImplementedError with a pointer back to
  TRANSPOSITION.md §4.

```
function tslPhonemeEncoder(input: TslInput): TslEncoding {
  // PROPRIETARY SLOT: see studies/<slug>/TRANSPOSITION.md §4 (slot: tsl-phoneme-encoder)
  throw new Error("Proprietary slot — implement before running fidelity tests");
}
```

Stubs are deliberately runnable scaffolding — the surrounding code compiles and
tests can be written, even though the stub itself throws until filled.

### Step 5: Write mechanism-fidelity tests (S13)

For each fidelity target in TRANSPOSITION.md §8, generate one entry in
`evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl`:

```json
{"mechanism_property": "...",
 "source_evidence": "studies/<slug>/BLUEPRINT.md:§4 / paper p.7 / file:line",
 "target_test_id": "fidelity-<slug>-<n>",
 "pass_threshold": "<concrete metric>",
 "current_value": null}
```

Generate the matching test files under the conventions of `/eval-harness` for
the domain (e.g., `evals/fidelity/<slug>/test-<n>.ts`). Each test imports the
scaffolded code, runs the property check, and writes `current_value` back to
the JSONL line on success.

These tests are **written before** the proprietary slots are filled — they will
fail until implementation lands. That's intentional. TDD on mechanism properties.

### Step 6: Generate the `/autoplan-full`-compatible build plan

Write `studies/<slug>/build-plan.md` with the standard sections `/autoplan-full`
expects:

1. **Implementation scope** — what `/autobuild` should produce.
2. **Architecture** — re-derive from BLUEPRINT.md + TRANSPOSITION.md; include
   ASCII diagrams.
3. **File list** — every scaffolded file from Steps 3-4 + every test from Step 5.
4. **Implementation Tasks** — checkbox list `/autobuild` consumes:
   - `- [ ] #1: scaffold core skeleton (STAY rows)`
   - `- [ ] #2: scaffold domain adapters (ADAPT rows)`
   - `- [ ] #3: stub replacement modules (REPLACE rows)`
   - `- [ ] #4: stub proprietary slots (interfaces only)`
   - `- [ ] #5: write mechanism-fidelity tests (red, will fail until slots filled)`
   - `- [ ] #6: wire imports + cross-module types`
   - `- [ ] #7: smoke-test the skeleton compiles / loads`
5. **Test plan** — link to `evals/fidelity/<slug>/`.
6. **Edge cases** — pulled from TRANSPOSITION.md §6 (new-domain edge cases).
7. **Out of scope** — explicitly NOT in this build: the proprietary slot
   *implementations* (those are Hall's manual work after the scaffold lands).

### Step 7: Open BUILD-LOG.md

Create `studies/<slug>/BUILD-LOG.md` with the S12 frontmatter and an empty
"Commits" section. Each future commit `/autobuild` lands MUST append:

```
- <commit-sha> <subject>
  - Blueprint section: §<n>
  - Transposition row: #<n>
  - Files: <list>
```

The skill that watches commits (`/autobuild` or a post-commit hook) is responsible
for appending. This skill seeds the file structure.

### Step 8: Hand off

Two paths:

- **`--mode full` (default):** Invoke `/autobuild` with `studies/<slug>/build-plan.md`
  as the plan. `/autobuild` runs the checkboxed tasks atomically, commits each,
  and appends to BUILD-LOG.md. After `/autobuild` returns, this skill runs
  `/verify-loop` once to catch transposition gaps (missing imports, untested
  edges, slot stubs that aren't wired).
- **`--mode plan-only`:** Stop after writing build-plan.md, BUILD-LOG.md, the
  scaffold, and the fidelity tests. Print:

```
Plan + scaffold ready: studies/<slug>/build-plan.md
Next: /autobuild studies/<slug>/build-plan.md
```

### Step 9: Write FIDELITY-EVAL.md

After the build completes (or right away in `plan-only`), write
`studies/<slug>/FIDELITY-EVAL.md`:

```yaml
---
target: <study target>
mode: fidelity-eval
version: 1
derived_from: ["studies/<slug>/BLUEPRINT.md", "studies/<slug>/TRANSPOSITION.md"]
---
```

Sections:

1. **Fidelity contract** — table of property / source evidence / target test /
   threshold / current value (mirrors `evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl`).
2. **Status** — for each property: `PRE-IMPL` (slot not filled), `RED` (impl
   landed, test failing), `GREEN` (test passing), `DEGRADED` (passing below
   threshold but within acceptable degradation declared in TRANSPOSITION.md §8).
3. **Notes** — why any property is `DEGRADED` or skipped.

### Step 10: Self-check + report

- [ ] All three refusal gates passed (Step 0).
- [ ] Every scaffolded file has the derivation header comment (Step 3).
- [ ] Every proprietary slot is interface-only, throws on call (Step 4).
- [ ] `evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl` has ≥1 entry; matching tests exist (Step 5).
- [ ] `studies/<slug>/build-plan.md`, `BUILD-LOG.md`, and `FIDELITY-EVAL.md` exist.
- [ ] No verbatim copies of source-target code, marketing, or images anywhere in
      the scaffold (grep for likely copy-paste markers; warn loudly if found).

Print:

```
Clone-and-twist complete:
- Scaffold:           <target-dir>/...  (<N> files)
- Proprietary slots:  <N> stubbed
- Fidelity tests:     <N> red (will turn green as slots get filled)
- Build plan:         studies/<slug>/build-plan.md
- Build log:          studies/<slug>/BUILD-LOG.md
- Fidelity eval:      studies/<slug>/FIDELITY-EVAL.md
- Branch:             <branch>

Next steps:
  /autobuild studies/<slug>/build-plan.md   # if --mode plan-only
  /recipe <slug>                            # after build lands, document YOURS
```

```

---

## Edge cases

- **Trivial domain shift (S5 gate fail).** Refuse. Do not silently downgrade
  to a "soft clone" mode — there isn't one.
- **Zero proprietary slots (S4 gate fail).** Refuse.
- **Zero fidelity targets (S8 gate fail).** Refuse — without fidelity tests,
  there's no way to know the transposition preserved the mechanism.
- **Target dir already has conflicting code.** AskUserQuestion: archive existing
  to `<target-dir>.pre-twist/` or abort.
- **`/autobuild` partially completes.** Resume from the BUILD-LOG.md checkbox
  state on next invocation; do not regenerate the scaffold.
- **Slot stub accidentally pasted real impl.** Self-check Step 10 scans slot
  stubs for body length > 1 line; warns. The slot author can override by adding
  a `// LITERAL-IMPL-OK` marker after re-confirming via AskUserQuestion.
- **Verbatim-copy detection.** Scan scaffold for code blocks that match more
  than ~25 consecutive tokens from any file in `studies/<slug>/evidence/`. Any
  match is a hard fail — block the build until the copy is paraphrased.
- **GPL/AGPL source from `/blueprint` `--mode code`.** Re-surface the license
  warning here even if it was acked in `/blueprint`. Transpositions inherit the
  obligation if mechanism is copied; require AskUserQuestion ack again.

## Dependencies

- **`/blueprint`** + **`/transpose`** — required upstream.
- **`/autoplan-full`** — output format compatibility (build-plan.md sections).
- **`/autobuild`** — execution; reads build-plan.md, lands commits, appends BUILD-LOG.md.
- **`/eval-harness`** — consumes `evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl`; runs mechanism-
  fidelity tests against the scaffold + slot fills.
- **`/verify-loop`** — invoked after `/autobuild` in `--mode full` to catch
  transposition gaps.
- **S12** — frontmatter chain `derived_from`.
- **S13** — `evals/fidelity/<slug>.jsonl` schema.
- **`lib/study-artifacts.ts`** — shared parser for S12 frontmatter (planned).

## Canonical examples

- **fingerspelling.xyz → TSL** (post-`/transpose`). Scaffold: core spaced-rep
  loop (STAY), TSL phoneme/handshape adapter (ADAPT), Thai UI module (REPLACE),
  proprietary slots `tsl-phoneme-encoder`, `tsl-pedagogy-ordering`, `tsl-eval-set`.
  Fidelity tests: "spaced-rep schedule preserves the source paper's retention
  curve" (cite paper) and "TSL-specific phonemes are 100% covered by the
  pedagogy graph" (target-domain invariant).

- **supertonic-v3** (inference → fine-tuning). Scaffold: model architecture +
  data loader (STAY), training-loop adapter (ADAPT), gradient-accumulation +
  checkpoint cadence (REPLACE), proprietary slots `training-strategy`,
  `regularization-schedule`, `eval-suite`. Fidelity tests: "fine-tuned model
  still passes the inference-only eval at ≥98% of baseline" and "gradient
  accumulation produces numerically equivalent updates to ungrouped step at
  micro-batch=1".

Use these as the v1 dogfood targets.
